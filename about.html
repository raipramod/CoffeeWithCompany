    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the
    Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee.
    The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground
    into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.
    
    Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine
    content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways
    (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled
    or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance
    the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that
    sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops
    selling cannabis). Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a
    stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption has positive or negative
    effects.[5]
    
    Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The
    earliest credible evidence of the drinking of coffee in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from
    the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current
    methods.[2</p>
