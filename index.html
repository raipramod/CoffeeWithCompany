    <h3>House Blend Coffee</h3>

    <p style="width:50%">Here “house blend” seems to describe a blend brought to as little darker roast than a “breakfast blend” though not
    nearly as dark as blends labeled “espresso roast” or “French roast.” Finally, house blends, unique or not, are generally
    expected to offer value to the customer</p>

    <p style="width:50%">French (alt. Turkish, Dark, Espresso) is the name applied to a degree of roast of coffee beans resulting in a dark brown
    coffee bean. In this roast, the beans are well into the second crack. French roasted beans will have a dark brown color
    and a shiney surface from its oils.</p>

    <img src="./images/columbian-roast.jpeg" alt="house blend" />
    <p style="width:50%">Colombian coffee also has a dark roast used to make rich espresso blends. Remember that the roast of the coffee isn't
    actually related to the growth of the coffee. Colombia is famous for its coffee beans, which can be used to make both
    light roasts and dark roasts.</p>
